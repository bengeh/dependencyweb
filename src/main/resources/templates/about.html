        <h1>This web application is done for the final year project by Geh Ming Chang Benjamin, student of Computer Science of Nanyang Technological University.
        <br/>
        Why this web application?<br/>

        This application is created because prior to this, the ways to scan for dependencies is through command lines, and it is not very user friendly
        to non-power users of the command line. Users have to know how to use command line prompts and syntax in order to scan dependencies, therefore,
        I have created this web application to simplify things.

        <br/>
        How this application works?<br/>

        All you have to do is just import the file, and the web application will scan the file with respect to the database from NVD.
